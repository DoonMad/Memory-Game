# Memory Game

## Overview
The Memory Game is a fun, interactive web-based game where players match pairs of cards. As players progress, they face increasingly challenging levels with more cards and different themes. The game tracks the player's performance by recording the best time, fewest moves, and misses for each level.

## Features
- **Dynamic Themes**: Each level has a unique color theme (e.g., green for easy, orange for medium, red for hard).
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks the best time, fewest moves, and misses for every level.
- **Levels**: Three levels of increasing difficulty with more cards at higher levels.
- **Reset and Next Level Buttons**: Restart the current level or advance to the next level.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Click on cards to reveal their hidden symbols.
3. Match pairs of cards to clear the board.
4. Complete the level in the fewest moves and time to set records.
5. Advance to the next level by clicking the "Next Level" button.
